# 📊 Sales and Marketing Budget Analysis

A beginner-friendly data analysis project exploring how **marketing budget** influences **sales performance** using **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**.

---

## 🏢 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of marketing investments on business sales outcomes.  
It combines **ROI computation** and **regression analysis** to evaluate marketing efficiency and identify whether the budget should be **increased or optimized**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Measure the relationship between marketing spend and sales.  
2. Calculate **Marketing Return on Investment (MROI)**.  
3. Estimate **incremental sales lift** per ₦1,000 marketing spend.  
4. Apply **regression analysis** to predict sales outcomes.  
5. Recommend whether to **increase or optimize** the marketing budget.

---

## ❓ Business Questions
- What is the calculated **MROI** based on incremental contribution?  
- Should the marketing **budget be increased or optimized**?  
- What is the **incremental sales lift (₦)** per ₦1,000 spent?  
- What are the **average sales and average marketing budget**?  
- What does the **regression model** reveal about the relationship between sales and marketing?

---

## 🧮 Methodology
- Data was cleaned and analyzed using **Microsoft Excel**.  
- **ROI** was calculated using:

  \[
  ROI = \frac{(Sales - Marketing\ Budget)}{Marketing\ Budget} \times 100
  \]

- **Regression Analysis** was performed in Excel:

  \[
  Sales = a + b \times (Marketing\ Budget)
  \]

- **Power BI** was used to visualize trends and insights.

## 📊 Regression Analysis Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Multiple R | 0.837 |
| R Square | 0.700 |
| Adjusted R Square | 0.699 |
| Standard Error | ₦43,055.53 |
| Observations | 222 |
| Significance F | 1.9 × 10⁻⁵⁹ |

| Coefficient | Estimate | Interpretation |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Intercept (a)** | ₦30,453.23 | Base sales level without marketing spend |
| **Slope (b)** | 0.0141 | Every ₦1 spent on marketing increases sales by ₦0.0141 |

---

## 🔍 Interpretation
- **R² = 0.70** → 70% of sales variation is explained by marketing budget changes.  
- **p-value < 0.001** → Marketing budget significantly influences sales.  
- **Slope (b = 0.0141)** → ₦1,000 marketing spend generates roughly ₦14,100 in additional sales.  
- Marketing investments are **efficient and profitable**, indicating an opportunity for optimization rather than major budget expansion.

---

## 💡 Key Results
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Average ROI (%)** | 405% |
| **Average Sales (₦)** | 148,000 |
| **Average Marketing Budget (₦)** | 30,000 |
| **Incremental Sales per ₦1,000** | ₦14,100 |
| **Recommendation** | Optimize budget (do not increase yet) |

---

## 📈 Insights
- Marketing budget has a **strong positive correlation** with sales.  
- Each ₦1 spent yields ₦3.5–₦5 return.  
- Regression confirms marketing as a key sales driver.  
- ROI performance suggests **budget optimization** will sustain profitability.

---

## 📊 Visualization Summary
- **Line Chart:** Marketing Budget Trend (Month)  
- **Column Chart:** Sales vs Budget  
- **Scatter Plot:** Relationship between Sales and Budget  
- **KPI Cards:** Total Sales • Total Budget • ROI % • Incremental Lift  

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that marketing spending substantially impacts sales outcomes (R² = 0.70, ROI ≈ 405%).  
Marketing efforts are efficient; thus, rather than expanding the budget, the company should **optimize current spending** and focus on **targeted campaigns**.
